Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. We're rescuing ya.

Well, then good news! It's a suppository. We're also Santa Claus! There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Hey, guess what you're accessories to.

I'll get my kit! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! You don't know how to do any of those. It's a T.
